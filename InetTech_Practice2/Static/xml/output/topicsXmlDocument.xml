    <name>Verbs: Regular, Irregular</name>
    <content>Verbs are action words that show what someone or something is doing. Verbs types: regular, irregular. Regular verbs follow a pattern when changing tenses, usually by adding "-ed" to the base form to form the past tense. Irregular verbs don't follow a regular pattern when changing tenses. Their forms change in unique ways.</content>
